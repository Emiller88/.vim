# My Little Vim

A distro for web designers, developers and various other masochists. Set up mainly for vim and macvim.

Currently, it's only been tested on mac and \*nix, so anyone else, your milage may vary.

Plenty of what's in here was inspired by a bunch of people; among them, [spf13](https://github.com/spf13), but I've tried to iron out a few kinks in his setup that simply didn't work with me.

## Vundle!

It takes care of updating all your plugins, and even updates itself. Could you want more?

# Installation

Easiest way to install is to clone and run a script.

```bash

    git clone https://github.com/hlissner/mlvim.git ~/.mlvim-git
    cd ~/.mlvim-git
    setup.sh

```

It will set up vundle, start up vim, install the plugins, and you should be good to go!
