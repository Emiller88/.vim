# Vim

In the terminal, remotely--wherever GUI [emacs] isn't an option, vim is my lean,
mean weapon of choice.

Tailored for Neovim, but will still work in vanilla Vim.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/.vim ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
make install    # installs vim-plug + sets up symlinks + installs plugins
```

## Will this work on Windoâ€”
